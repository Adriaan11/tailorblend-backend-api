  # Readiness Check

  Returns 200 when the API is fully initialized and ready to serve requests.
  Returns 503 during startup/initialization.

  **Use case**:
  - Wait for heavy OpenAI SDK initialization to complete
  - Ensure agents are loaded before routing traffic

  **Responses**:
  - `200`: `{"status": "ready"}`
  - `503`: `{"status": "not ready", "detail": "Application is still initializing"}`
}
